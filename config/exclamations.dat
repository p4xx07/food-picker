Aw, do we have to?
You two are dating? Awesome!
Aww, that's so cute!

Oh, baloney. I don't believe that.
Big deal. Who cares?
Bingo! Right on target!
Boo! Scared you!
That makes me sad. Boo-hoo.
Yeah, I aced this test. Booyah!
Oh boy. Oh boy, oh boy. That's heavy, man.
Bravo! That was fantastic!
Brilliant, luv, absolutely brilliant! (British English.)
Brr! Minus 30 degrees? Yuk.
Bull. It's not 30 below zero, not really.
Bye! See you later!
Cheers, mate! You're welcome. (British English); Cheers! Raise a toast! (American English.)
Come on. Hurry up.
Oh, wow, that is so cool!

Darn it! I can't find the other one either!
Oh, dear me. What are we going to do?
Duck! No, really! Get down!
Well, duh. I can't believe you didn't know that.
Eh? What?
Enjoy! I hope you like it!

Golly, that sure was tasty.
Goodbye, see you again soon!

Hey! Look over there!
Hi! What's up?
We won! On the count of three, everyone: Hip, hip hooray! Hip, hip, hooray!
Hmm. Let me think about that for a bit.
Ho-ho-ho, Merry Christmas!
Holy mackerel! I can't believe it!
Ho-hum, how boring.
Hooray! That's awesome!
Howdy, pardner.
Huh. I have no idea.

Nope. I can't do that.
Nuts! I wish I didn't have to.
Oh! That's shocking!
OK, sounds great. Thank you.
Ouch! That hurt!
Ow! That stung!
Would you help me, please?
Poof! She just disappeared.
Shh! Quiet in the library!
Super! That's fantastic!
Swell! How great!
